    <h1>Inner Self  </h1>

<br>    Walking these dirty streets
<br>    With hate in my mind
<br>    Feeling the scorn of the world
<br>    I won't follow rules
<br>    Blame and lies, contradictions arise
<br>    Blame and lies, contradictions arise
<br>    Nonconformity in my inner self
<br>    Only I guide my inner self
<br>    I won't change my way
<br>  It has to be this way
<br>    I live my life for myself
<br>    Forget your filthy ways
<br>    Blame and lies, contradictions arise
<br>    Blame and lies, contradictions arise
<br>    Nobody will change my way
<br>    Life betrays, but I keep on going
<br> There's no light, but there is hope
<br> Crushing oppression, I win
<br> Betraying, playing dirty, you think you'll win
<br> But someday you'll fall, and I'll be waiting
<br> Laughs of an insane man, you'll hear
<br> Personality is my weapon against your envy
<br> Walking these dirty streets
<br> With hate in my mind
<br> Feeling all the scorn of the world
<br> I won't follow your rules
<br> Nonconformity in my inner self
<br> Only I guide my inner self
